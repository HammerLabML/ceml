Counterfactuals for Explaining Machine Learning models - ceml
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ceml is a Python toolbox for computing counterfactuals. Counterfactuals can be use to explain the predictions of machine learing models.

It supports many common machine learning frameworks:

    - scikit-learn
    - PyTorch
    - Keras
    - Tensorflow

Furthermore, ceml is easy to use and can be extended very easily. See the following user guide for more information on how to use and extend ceml.
