Counterfactuals for Explaining Machine Learning models - CEML
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CEML is a Python toolbox for computing counterfactuals. Counterfactuals can be used to explain the predictions of machine learing models.

It supports many common machine learning frameworks:

    - scikit-learn (0.22.2)
    - PyTorch (1.5.0)
    - Keras & Tensorflow (2.2.0)

Furthermore, CEML is easy to use and can be extended very easily. See the following user guide for more information on how to use and extend ceml.
